# Welcome to project Sneakers

This is a web development project for a fictional sneaker's brand - Brand 22.

## Tools of the trade

I am using React.js along with react router to design the structure and layout as well as minimal CSS to style.

## Key Notes

Some components have their own CSS files, and some are fed through the App.css script. The color scheme of the site is guided by the root variables inside index.css

The pages {Brand, Products, Signup} still need to be constructed.

## Current Project Needs

- The first card's background breaks a little in full window resolution.

- The navbar items in full resolution are not on the same line.

- The links in the footer are all unfunctional - all link to the homepage for now.
